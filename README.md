# Country-Based Redirection Website

## Project Description

This project aims to create a website that dynamically loads different pages based on the user's geographical location. Using geolocation based on IP addresses, the website checks the country of the visitor and displays either a video page or a custom error page, depending on the location.

The goal was to create an interactive experience that adapts to the user's region, offering customized content based on where they are visiting from. This type of setup can be useful for various types of regional content control, marketing campaigns, or simply for displaying content in a localized way.

## Features

- *Geolocation-Based Redirection*: The website checks the visitor's country and dynamically shows content tailored for that location.
- *Custom Error Page*: Users from certain countries are redirected to a custom error page with a friendly message.
- *Responsive Design*: The website is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
- *Embedded Video*: The website includes an embedded video that showcases a project or content when accessed by users not in restricted regions.

## Technologies Used

- *React*: The core library for building the user interface.
- *Axios*: For making HTTP requests to fetch geolocation data.
- *React Router*: For handling page navigation based on location.
- *GeoJS API*: For geolocation based on the user's IP address.
- *HTML5 & CSS3*: For building the website structure and responsive design.
